// Static starter clauses for the Lease Builder's template library. Not DB
// rows — a fixed reference list has no need for per-user/global template
// modeling; "using" one just snapshots it onto a lease, and "copying" one
// creates a normal, fully editable Clause the landlord owns. Locked by
// construction: there is no edit/delete endpoint that ever touches this
// list, so nothing can silently modify what we ship while it still reads as
// "provided" — landlords who want changes copy first.
//
// Genericized from a real signed Colorado lease (Zillow-drafted, plus
// Taylor's own hand-added Early Termination clause, added via a Rules
// Addendum because the Zillow template itself can't be edited — the actual
// reason this feature exists). Dates, dollar amounts, and names are removed
// in favor of {{variable}} placeholders resolved from the lease's own linked
// Property/Tenant/Entity/numeric fields at generation time; anything not
// already modeled in this app (per-property acceptable payment methods,
// per-property utility list, specific parking/storage space identifiers)
// is left as plain generic text — some with a "[bracketed prompt]" the
// landlord fills in per lease — for the landlord to edit.
//
// **Aug 2026 — replaced by a rigorous, per-clause Colorado verification pass
// (backend and this file only ever held CO + a scattered set of unverified
// other-state clauses before this).** Full methodology, statute-by-statute
// findings, and every correction made along the way live in
// `lease-clause-decision-log-CO.md` (repo root) — read that before touching
// this file. `lease-clauses-CO.csv` (repo root) is the structured source of
// truth this file is generated from; treat the CSV + decision log as
// authoritative and this file as their compiled output.
//
// `states` redefined this pass: it is no longer "blank = universal." A
// clause only carries a state once that state's law has actually been
// checked against it — blank/`[]` now means "not yet verified against any
// state," not "safe everywhere." Practical effect: every clause below
// (including pure contract-mechanics ones like Rent Payment, Keys,
// Severability) is now tagged `["CO"]`, because that's the only state that's
// gone through the full pass. A non-CO property will see a mostly-empty
// Provided Clauses pool until that state gets its own verified pass —
// deliberate, not a bug (see the decision log's §2 for the tradeoff). The
// ~51 clauses that only ever went through an earlier, high-level, unverified
// nationwide pass (other states' late fee/NSF/deposit/disclosure variants)
// have been pulled out of this shipped file entirely rather than displayed
// unverified — their content isn't lost, it's preserved in the CSV/decision
// log as a roadmap for whenever that state gets its own real pass.
//
// A state-specific clause that fully replaces a universal one's content
// (not just adds a number, but restates everything the universal clause
// covers) can set `supersedes: "<universal-clause-id>"`. When the library or
// attach picker is filtered to a specific state, a superseded universal
// clause is hidden in favor of its more specific replacement.
//
// Per-clause research metadata (rule type, content-type bucket,
// verification status, and research notes from the CO pass) lives in the
// sibling file `clauseResearchMetadata.js`, keyed by clause id — kept
// deliberately separate from this array (rather than added as fields here)
// so it never flows through `GET /api/clause-templates`, which spreads
// these objects directly into the API response. It's there for future
// automated consistency checks (e.g. "no rent-related clause implies a rent
// increase more than once per 12 months"), not for the UI.
//
// A second sibling file, `landlordEducation.js`, holds real verified CO law
// that the same research pass explicitly decided does NOT belong here —
// content with no tenant-facing disclosure value (e.g. the security deposit
// cap, which only gives a tenant a number to hold the landlord to) or
// standing landlord conduct rules (retaliation, rent-increase frequency).
// See `lease-clause-decision-log-CO.md` §7 for the three-bucket test that
// sorts a research finding into LEASE_CLAUSE vs. LANDLORD_EDUCATION vs.
// OUT_OF_SCOPE.
//
// IMPORTANT: several of the underlying Colorado rules specifically changed
// within the last 1-2 years (deposit cap Jan 2026, HB 25-1249 wear-and-tear
// rules, HB 25-1090 "Honest Pricing" utility/fee rules Jan 2026, entry
// notice reframing, month-to-month for-cause reform 2024) — this is a
// well-researched snapshot as of Aug 2026, not a substitute for an attorney
// or a fresh check of current law before relying on it in a real lease. The
// decision log proposes an annual re-verification cadence in late summer.
